# 1. Task: conditional statements

Implement a function `get_number_stats(numbers: list) -> dict`, which returns dictionary with these values:
  - `max` - maximum number from the list. 
  - `min` - minimum numbers from the list.
  - `average` - average number (sum/len) from the list.
  - `in_interval_count` - how many numbers are in interval [0, 10].
  - `positive_count` - how many positive numbers.
  - `negative_count` - how many negative numbers.
  - `zero_count` - how many numbers are equal to 0.
  - `positive_sum` - total sum of positive numbers.
  - `negative_sum` - total sum of negative numbers.

# 2. Task: indexes in a for loop
Implement a function `get_max_pair_sum(numbers: list) -> float`, which returns maximum value of 
`a1 + a2, a2 + a3, ..., an-1 + an`, where `a1, ..., aN` are numbers in the list.

# 3. Task: data structure in a dictionary
Implement a function `find_words_with_repeated_letters(input_filename: str) -> list`, which returns
a list of words, which have repeated more than once in the text and have duplicate letters
(e.g. word "letters" have duplicate "e" and "t").

Bonus points for providing:
- the frequency of those words by implementing:
`find_counts_of_words_with_repeated_letters(input_filename: str) -> dict[str, int]`.
- which letters were repeated in each word and how many times:
`find_repeated_letters_counts_in_words(input_filename: str) -> dict[str, dict[str, int]]`.
